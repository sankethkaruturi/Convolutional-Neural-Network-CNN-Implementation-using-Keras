# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-Implementation-using-Keras
ðŸ§  This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images and analyze performance by plotting cross-validation and test error. Multiple architectures with stacked layers are tested to compare results. The work was done in collaboration with the appliedAI team based in India.
